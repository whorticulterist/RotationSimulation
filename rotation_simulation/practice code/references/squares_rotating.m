% For this Demo we will draw 3 squares

    % With this basic way of drawing we have to translate each square from
    % its screen position, to the coordinate [0 0], then rotate it, then
    % move it back to its screen position.
    % This is rather inefficient when drawing many rectangles at high
    % refresh rates. But will work just fine for simple drawing tasks.
    % For a much more efficient way of drawing rotated squares and rectangles
    % have a look at the texture tutorials

        posX = posXs(i);
